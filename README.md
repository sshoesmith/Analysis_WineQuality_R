Analysis of Factors Affecting Wine Quality- Udacity Project

This github repository contains my project which took a tidy dataset (provided by Udacity) on wine quality and factors
that possible affect the quality rating.
Using R, I investigated which factors may have impacted the quality of the wine. These factors include alcohol level,
acidity, sulphates, to name a few. I used ggplot graphing functions to visualize the data.

In order to view the project, you will need to download R version 3.4.3. The following packages are required:
GGally
dpylr
gridExtra
knitr

I've also attached a pdf summarizing all the visualizations.
